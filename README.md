# Sprint 1 Design Document
Zephyr semester project

## Deployment Environment 
The project is hosted on an EC2 server and can be accessed by the user on an internet connected device. A Raspberry PI controls the system and the hardware associated with it including motion sensors, lights, and a camera. 

## Functional Requirements

### Adjust Lights
1. The system should control attributes of the lights remotely via user input.
2. The system must update to manual actions done by the user.
3. The system should know what attributes of the lights can be changed.
4. The system should restrict users from lights based off privilege.

### Front Door Camera
1. The sensor must detect movement.
2. The camera must take a photo of visitor.
3. The database must be updated to have accurate information of the system's status.
4. The users are notified of an event.
5. The users can check the status and view the photo taken by the camera.
6. The user can view a live stream of outside their front door.

### Television Time Restriction
1. The Zephyr system should login users before use.
2. The Zephyr system should log the shows watched.
3. The Zephry system should log the amount of time each show is watched.
4. The Zephry system should handle ending the session gracefully.

## Files

### User Interface Files

#### Front Door UI 
1. A container with the current status of the front door and a thumbnail of the outside view.
2. A table holding previous records that include a timestamp of an event and the corresponding photo taken at the time.

#### Television Time Restriction
1. Login screen for admin (Similar sign up screen)
2. A screen with all connected devices, and all devices trying to pair with the system. 
3. After selecting a device, you can select accounts on the televisions to pull up the restriction page
4. The restrictions page will have different fields that will allow the admin to create different types of rules

### Model Files

#### Front Door Model
1. Photo: A photo is taken and saved along the time it was taken.
2. Status: The status of the front door is recorded and updated for every event.

### Controller Files

#### Front Door Controller
1. Sensor functions
* movement_listen(): the system activates actively listens for movement, which triggers the next function.
* activate_camera(): the system proceeds to activate the camera.

2. Camera functions
* sensor_listen(): the camera is only active if the sensor has been activated.
* take_photo(): a photo is taken and saved into the database.
* sleep(): the camera sleeps after a certain amount of time after there is no longer movement detected until awoken again.

3. App functions
* stream_surveillance(): opens a connection between the camera and app to allow the user to see outside the front door.

### Languages

1. Python
* Python is the main language used for this project. Python is used to access the database server and controlling a hardware device.
2. Skill gaps
* Jon: no experience coding in Python
* Everyone: no experience connecting to devices with Bluetooth and hardware in general
* Zach: experience with cmake files and in general larger scale low-level development
